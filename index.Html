        <h1>Bio:</h1>
        <p>Throughout my time in my IST course, I've completed several projects for a grade, each testing my knowledge
            on
            different topics. I came to this course with a fair bit of general computer science and internet know-how,
            and
            found good use for many of my skills in creating these. Below details each of my projects and the exact
            knowledge that was tested.
